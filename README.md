This repo's is apparently a personal page that belongs to Alin Stefan Olaru (not sure why I wanted to write my name.

## Base Structure
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

### Build/Deployment
Project is automatically built and deployed on GitHub Pages with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/alstol/alstol.github.io/actions). Feel free to [yoink](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yoink) my workflow.
You can see the compiled application under the [master branch](https://github.com/alstol/alstol.github.io/tree/master). Nothing really impressive there.

### Why overlycomplicate something that can be done with simple HTML?
For science!
